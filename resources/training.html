        <p>By Group5| July 10, 2021 | Article</p>

        <p>    On November 22, the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) organized the training module 4 "Building
            teaching and education plans in the direction of developing students' quality and capacity" for 95 key
            lecturers in the subject. Foreign languages ​​of 7 key pedagogical schools participating in ETEP program and
            Can Tho University, University of Foreign Languages ​​- Hanoi National University.

        <p>    In the opening remarks, the Deputy Minister of Education and Training assessed that the training module 4 on
            building school education plans and teaching plans towards developing quality and student capacity for key
            foreign language teachers was very important. Because, these are the "computers" that will continue to train
            the content that is fundamentally different between the general education program (GET) 2018 and this 2006
            curriculum, for the core staff of foreign language teachers in schools. schools across the country, and at
            the same time support mass teachers to self-educate online.</p>


            

        <p>    According to the Deputy Minister, GDPT 2006 is "subsidized" throughout the country, schools carry out a
            common distribution of the program, following the instructions from a single set of textbooks. The 2018 GDPR
            program directly decentralizes schools to actively develop their own educational plans, in accordance with
            the implementation conditions of the institution. Teachers, on the basis of the general plan of the school,
            of the professional group, will develop a lesson plan with teaching activities, teaching methods and
            assessment suitable for students, helping them formation and development of qualities and capacities.</p>

         <p>   “With a deep awareness of the important role of teachers in the quality of education and training, the
            Ministry of Education and Training has directed the implementation of rigorous and methodical training
            activities. And in order for teachers to properly understand and effectively implement these training
            contents, from the very beginning, when training key teachers - the "souls" of training courses for high
            school teachers, we must quality assurance”, said Deputy Minister Nguyen Huu Do and suggested that lecturers
            participating in the training course would be serious and responsible. Lecturers must have a thorough
            understanding of the 2018 curriculum, the differences compared with the 2006 curriculum, especially in the
            development and implementation of school education plans and teaching plans; thereby guiding and supporting
            teachers to implement effectively.</p>

         <p>   According to the report of the organizers, 95 key foreign language lecturers who trained in module 4 had 5
            days of self-researching online materials. After 3 days of direct discussion with source reporters who are
            leaders of relevant units under the Ministry, experts from universities, the lecturers will continue to
            self-study online documents and complete the first assessment. out of the course.</p>

         <p>   Noting more about the development and implementation of a school education plan for foreign languages, Dr.
            Thai Van Tai - Director of the Department of Primary Education said that, from grade 3 according to the 2018
            curriculum, students will start learning English subject. However, from grade 1, grade 2, students can be
            familiar with this foreign language according to the curriculum and many textbooks appraised and issued by
            the Ministry of Education and Training. With 70 lessons/year of English for each grade 1 and 2, the Ministry
            of Education and Training has organized a warehouse of lectures to be broadcast on television, so that
            students, even in schools in difficult areas, where teachers have not been arranged, can still learn, get
            acquainted.</p>

        <p>    “When developing school education plans, I hope that educational institutions will have their own goals for
            English subject; which tries to make 100% of students get acquainted with this foreign language from grade
            1, 2, in many different ways, including learning solutions on television. The ultimate goal is to support
            students to have equal access to education, gradually eliminating the regional gap in foreign language
            teaching," said Director General Thai Van Tai.</p>
