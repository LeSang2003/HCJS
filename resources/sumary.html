        <h1>Summary of the program to evaluate the results of primary school students in Southeast Asia</h1>
        <p>By Group5| Jan 28, 2021 | Article</p>
        <img src="./nuocngoai.jpeg" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
        <div class="host">
         <p>   On the morning of October 1, the Ministry of Education and Training (Education and Training) held a
            conference to review the program on assessing the learning outcomes of primary school students in Southeast
            Asia (SEA-PLM) for the 2018-2021 period. The conference was held in an online format with the participation
            of UNICEF representatives in Vietnam, representatives of the Departments of Education and Training, a number
            of universities and primary schools participating in the assessment program. Deputy Minister Nguyen Huu Do
            chaired the Conference.</p>

        <p>    Vietnamese students ranked first in 3 areas: Math, Reading and Writing
            SEA-PLM is a program that assesses 5th grade students in the areas of Mathematics, Literacy, Writing and
            Global Citizenship, emphasizing the quality and depth of ongoing learning in these areas. .</p>

        <p>    SEA-PLM serves the goal of improving the quality of education through systematic monitoring of student
            learning outcomes. At the same time, support SEAMEO member countries to better measure and understand
            student achievement as a whole and for individual groups by applying culturally appropriate metrics to
            learning outcomes. in Reading, Writing, Mathematics and Global Citizenship.</p>

        <p>    There are 6 countries, namely Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Vietnam participating
            in the first survey cycle SEA-PLM in the period 2018-2021, the official survey in 2019. The results in 3
            areas are Math, Reading Comprehension and Writing of Vietnam are the highest among the 6 countries
            participating in the official SEA-PLM 2019 survey.</p>

         <p>   Specifically, in the field of Mathematics, the average score of Vietnamese students is 341.55 points.
            Meanwhile, the average score of students from 6 countries is 304.79 points. In Reading Comprehension, the
            average score of Vietnamese students is 336.46 points. Meanwhile, the average score of students from 6
            countries is 300 points. In Writing, the average score of Vietnamese students is 328.01 points. Meanwhile,
            the average score of students from 6 countries is 304.92 points.</p>

         <p>   Detailed analysis of survey results in Vietnam shows that students in remote areas are still far from
            students in other areas in terms of results in 3 areas. Female students' academic performance in the field
            of Mathematics was similar to that of male students, but in the areas of Reading and Writing, female
            students achieved higher results than male students.</p>

         <p>   Students from families with good economic conditions, with high average have a large difference in average
            scores and proficiency levels compared to students from families with low average economic conditions. The
            higher the education level of parents, the better the academic performance of their children. In addition,
            parents' occupations and learning conditions at home also have a great influence on students' learning
            outcomes.</p>

         <p>   With the participation in SEA-PLM, in addition to the common goals of ASEAN countries, Vietnam is aiming for
            a number of specific goals such as integration with other countries in the region in education; measuring
            the educational level of Vietnam compared to other countries in the region; analyze the current state of
            education and make recommendations to change education policies to improve the quality of education in
            Vietnam better and better.</p>

         <p>   In addition, through the SEA PLM, Vietnam demonstrates its responsibility for the construction and
            development of the common home of Southeast Asian countries. SEA PLM's assessment also serves the cause of
            Vietnam's general education innovation.</p>

        <p>    Talking at the conference, representatives of some Departments of Education and Training, educational
            institutions highly appreciated the meaning and importance of SEA-PLM in the period of 2018-2021 for quality
            assessment and identification of problems to be overcome. to improve the quality of local education.</p>
        <p>    “We are building an open, real, hands-on education that teaches well, learns well and manages well.
            Therefore, the positive results when compared with education in other countries in the region and in the
            world will not only be a joy for the education sector but also a joy for the whole country," emphasized the
            Deputy Minister.</p>
