        <h2>Benefits of the Internet</h2>
        <div class="host">
            The Internet brings a lot of advantages to students in studying as well as researching. Firstly, the
            Internet allows students to access a huge source of information. They can go online and look for anything
            they need by using search engines such as Google, Yahoo, or directly visiting other professional websites.
            Some school libraries also have computers connected with the Internet for their students. Secondly, the
            Internet has enabled distance learning as well as e-learning. Thanks to the Internet, there are thousands of
            online courses available. If there werent the Internet, how could we keep studying during the Covid 19?
            Finally, films, music and different games on the Internet also help students to relax easily. In conclusion,
            there are a large number of benefits that the Internet brings to students.

        <h2>Why study online?</h2>
        <div class="host">
            In recent years, distance teaching and learning has become increasingly popular among the students and this
            is perceived differently by learners. Many students perceive this as a beneficial aid in learning while
            others think that they are not as much effective as classroom teaching. This essay will discuss about the
            merits and demerits of distant learning. Studying an online course provides a flexible timing and less
            budgeted learning for students. They are able to learn their desire course and subjects on their suitable
            time. This gives a great opportunity for learners to gain new skills and strengthen their knowledge level
            staying in their own place. For instance, a Nepali student who wants an Australian degree in business
            management course does not have to stay in Australia, he can study online and complete course staying at his
            home. Hence, distant learning is economic and time saving. However, online courses give more emphasis on the
            theoretical part of learning and there is less teacher and student interaction. It lacks the practical
            aspects of learning and encourage the passive learning. This is very obvious that students find it as a less
            effective learning than in the classroom. A recent study suggests that a greater number of students found
            classroom teaching far more effective than the distance learning. In conclusion, the ever growing
            availability of online learning has gained its popularity among the young adults for many years, which is
            perceived as beneficial by many people while others find it to be less effective. The emphasis can be given
            to its effectiveness to establish it as the most cost effective learning than the classroom teaching.

        <h2>Online learning in the time of Covid-19: It is still important for students' consciousness '</h2>
        <div class="host">
            <span>&#8727;Create order and awareness</span> <br>
            <p> According to the teachers, the discipline, the sense of learning is not natural, it must be through the
                process of training and striving. Therefore, students need to know how to adapt and turn difficulties
                into
                opportunities for themselves. Teachers only play the role of imparting and guiding students in the
                learning
                process.</p>

            <p> Vo Hoai Nhan Trung, Vice Principal of Nguyen Dinh Chieu High School suggested: "For online teaching, the
                teacher is only the one who guides the students in the methods, while the students will be the ones who
                practice and apply the methods. The key is still the students' sense of learning, they have to actively
                search for documents as well as through practical activities and experiments to gain knowledge for
                themselves."</p>

            <p> The central figure of the learning process is still the student. Students should make the days of online
                learning at home an opportunity in learning, through self-study. Students' self-study at home will
                include
                tasks such as: Solving exercises, solving problems assigned by teachers, reviewing knowledge learned in
                subjects... If teachers need support, , then students should boldly contact for effective help in the
                self-study process.</p>

            <p> In addition, in order for students to have a good routine and sense of learning, it is impossible not to
                mention the role of parents. Parents must identify their child's strengths and weaknesses in order to
                have
                an appropriate and effective online learning solution.</p>

            <span>&#8727;Many lessons learned</span>
            <p>A month of online teaching and learning has passed with many different emotions for both teachers and
                students. In fact, there have been many lessons learned by the Education industry for online teaching
                and learning.
            </p>

            <p>Students at Le Ngoc Han Secondary School study online.
                According to the analysis of Mr. Nguyen Phuong Toan, Deputy Director of the Department of Education and
                Training, the Education sector has experienced many online teaching and learning sessions in previous
                school years, but this is probably the most successful implementation of online teaching and learning.
                scale and synchronously at all levels from primary school (high school) to high school (high school) in
                the face of complicated developments of the Covid-19 epidemic. After more than a month of
                implementation, the whole Education sector has learned from experience, in which there are 03 basic
                factors contributing to the success of the online teaching method, which is to have a good solution in
                technology, the management of Student management of schools must be strict and conscious and disciplined
                of students.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding technology for online teaching and learning, although there are still many difficulties,
                especially the network transmission system, it has been basically overcome and gradually stabilized.
                Through statistics from schools and units in the province, 100% of students in grades 9 and 12 have
                qualified and studied online; 98% of high school students, 93% of middle school students and about 80%
                of TH students have participated in online learning. For students who do not have online learning
                devices, there have been many solutions by advocating for computer support, sending study sheets to
                students, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the management of students of educational institutions, more than 600 schools from primary to
                secondary levels have transformed from paper-based management to digital technology. From scheduling to
                checking lesson plans, preparing lectures, records, books, ... are all done by online methods. However,
                there are still many schools, especially rural schools, which are still slow to adapt to online
                learning; The schedule arrangement is not really flexible, which has put pressure on students…
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides, the awareness and learning habits of students also make many people wonder. Because, the
                attitude of students' readiness to learn online today depends a lot on many conditions, such as: age,
                student learning ability, regional and regional conditions, family circumstances... According to general
                assessment Most students are quite interested in this method of learning, however, there are still many
                students who are lazy in studying, study on time, do not pay attention to do exercises according to the
                teacher's instructions...
